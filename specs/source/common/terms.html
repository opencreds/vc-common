  This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
  Open Credentials space by using specific terms to discuss particular concepts. This
  terminology is included below and linked to throughout the document to aid
  the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A qualification, achievement, personal quality, aspect of an <a>entity's</a>
background such as a name, government ID, payment processor, home
address, or university degree, or verifiable statement by an entity about
another entity. Credentials may be stored in <a>identity documents</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="credential consumer|credential consumers|credential consumer's">credential consumer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that requests a <a>credential</a> from a
<a>recipient</a> for processing.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential exchange</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A transmission of a <a>credential</a> from one <a>entity</a> to another
<a>entity</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>credential service</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a <a>credential</a> storage vault or personal
credential wallet, that stores and protects access to an
<a>recipient's</a> credentials.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="decentralized identifier|decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable identifier that is associated with an <a>entity</a>. These
identifiers are most often used in a <a>credential</a> and are associated
with <a>recipients</a> such that the <a>credential</a> itself can be easily
ported from one <a>identity provider</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="decentralized identifier document|decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible via the <a>WebDHT</a> and contains information
related to a particular <a>decentralized identifier</a> such as the
associated <a>identity provider</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="entity|entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
or instance of a software program.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of information that can be used to identify a particular entity such as
a person, software agent, or organization. An entity may have multiple
identities associated with it.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="identity document|identity documents">identity document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A Web-based document that contains statements about a
particular <a>identity</a>. Identity documents MUST be accessible in
JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] format and MAY be accessible in other RDF-compatible formats.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>identity document URL</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identity document URL consists of an HTTP or HTTPS scheme and denotes an <a>identity</a>. For example:
<code>https://example.org/identities/manu</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="identity owner|identity owner's">identity owner</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An entity that is in control of a particular <a>identity document</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="identity provider|identity provider's">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A website providing access to one or more <a>identity documents</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="issuer|issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>credential</a> and associates it
with a particular <a>recipient</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn lt="recipient|recipients|recipient's">recipient</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> that is in control of a particular
<a>credential</a>. Typically a recipient is also the primary topic
of the information in a credential and is the <a>entity</a> that initiates
the transmission of the credential.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>recipients</a>, <a>issuers</a> and
<a>credential consumers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>WebDHT</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mechanism that is used to discover the software services, such as an
<a>identity provider</a>, associated with an <a>entity</a>.
Technically speaking, it is
a Web-based decentralized hashtable built on Web architecture principles that
is used to map cryptographic hashes to <a>decentralized identifiers</a> and
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> to <a>decentralized identifier documents</a>.
The technology is used to map cryptographic hashes of email addresses and
passphrases to <a>decentralized identifier documents</a> which can then be
used to discover an <a>entity's</a> <a>identity provider</a>. The technology is
one way of solving the
